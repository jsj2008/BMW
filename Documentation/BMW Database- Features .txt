  + Features To Do
      - Rewrite client interface to use our Query controller API (David Kamm). 
           *This requires some transitioning from the current URL routes to a single '/query?params=' URL route
      - Provide documentation for the Query Controller for Rob & Aaron(David Kamm & Minh Ly)
      - Implement new models in support for Achievements (Minh Ly)
      - Implement models for taking in car/HMI data (Minh Ly)
      - Implement model for taking into account car trips (Minh Ly)
      - Implement query for finding average speed of location (boxing all points in vicinity) and finding n closest points (Minh Ly)
      - Modify the way distance is calculated using GPS coordinates; current Euclidean implementation is inaccurate (David Kamm)
      - Modify current 'rankings' queries to take in new parameters. Work with Query Controller API (Minh & David)
      - Clean out deprecated database models (e.g.: incorrectly named models, columns, etc.) (David)
      - Modify the way time spent at redlights counts; so we group redlights together even if there is a small time gap.
