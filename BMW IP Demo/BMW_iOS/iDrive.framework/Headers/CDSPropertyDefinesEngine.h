 @define     engine.info
 @abstract   Returns information about the current engine such as number of Cylinders, number of gears, fuel type and gearbox type(ccm).
 @discussion Stored in a response key "info" as a dictionary with keys "displacement" "numberOfCylinders", "numberOfGears", "fuelType", and "gearboxType". 
 Possible values for numberOfCylinders are CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_4, CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_5, CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_6, CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_8, CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_10, CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_12, CDSEngineInfoNumCylinders_INVALID
 Possible values for numberOfGears are CDSEngineInfoNumGears_CONTINUOUS, CDSEngineInfoNumGears_4, CDSEngineInfoNumGears_5, CDSEngineInfoNumGears_6, CDSEngineInfoNumGears_7, CDSEngineInfoNumGears_8, CDSEngineInfoNumGears_INVALID
 Possible values for fuelType are CDSEngineInfoFxuelType_NOINFO, CDSEngineInfoFuelType_DIRECT_INJ_BENZINE, CDSEngineInfoFuelType_CONVENTIONAL_BENZINE, CDSEngineInfoFuelType_DIRECT_INJ_DIESEL, CDSEngineInfoFuelType_CONVENTIONAL_DIESEL, CDSEngineInfoFuelType_INVALID
 Possible values for gearboxType are CDSEngineInfoGearboxType_MANUAL, CDSEngineInfoGearboxType_AUTOMATIC, CDSEngineInfoGearboxType_STEPTRONIC, CDSEngineInfoGearboxType_SMG, CDSEngineInfoGearboxType_DOUBLECLUTCH, CDSEngineInfoGearboxType_INVALID
 displacement is returned as a number in ccm.
